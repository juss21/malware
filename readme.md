### [Audit Video]()

- How does ransomware work and the impact of it.
    - A malicious actor will encrypt numerous files making them, and often the systems that rely on them, unusable. If a ransom is not paid these encrypted files are often permanently locked requiring the organization to regenerate the information.

- What is ransomware?
    - Ransomware is a malware that encrypts and holds victim's personal files and information at ransom.

- How did I bypass the Anti-Viruses?
    - Because the script/hash is unique and not known by AVs, my starting detection rate wasn't as high (23/73).
    - I added an incrementation, a for loop that does a simple process for `1000000000` times.
    - Then I made a custom sleep function for the malware. Because some AV's skip `time.sleep()`

- How does my ransomware work?
    - I search for all files in a specified folder that end with given extentions.
    - Loop throught the files and encrypt them.

- How does my decrypting program work?
    - It asks for the correct encryption key as an input. And if the input fails to decrypt a file it asks for the key again.
    - When the key is correct, same as encryption it loops through the files and decrypts them.
