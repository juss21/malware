# Malware
The best way to understand malware is to be a Malware Developer. Its time to thing like black hat to understand how the ransomware work like (WannaCry).

For demonstration I'm only encrypting `Documents` folder.

- How does ransomware work and the impact of it.
    - A malicious actor will encrypt numerous files making them, and often the systems that rely on them, unusable. If a ransom is not paid these encrypted files are often permanently locked requiring the organization to regenerate the information.

- What is ransomware?
    - Ransomware is a malware that encrypts and holds victim's personal files and information at ransom.

- How did I bypass the Anti-Viruses?
    - Because the script/hash is unique and not known by AVs, my starting detection rate wasn't as high (23/73).
    - I added an incrementation, a for loop that does a simple process for `1000000000` times.
    - Then I made a custom sleep function for the malware. Because some AV's skip `time.sleep()`
    - I also refactored my code and didn't leave any obvious ransomware strings anywhere. 

- How does my ransomware work?
    - First it runs the incrementation and sleep timer to bypass AVs.
    - Then searches for all files in a specified folder that end with given extentions.
    - Loops throught the files, encrypt them and modifys their extension.

- How does my decrypting program work?
    - It asks for the correct encryption key as an input. And if the input fails to decrypt a file it asks for the key again.
    - When the key is correct, same as encryption it loops through the files and decrypts them.

- Imagine that they are your files and try to decrypt them without the help of the student.
Is there no way to decrypt the files?
    - Since all encryption packages work differently, it's really unlikely you'll succeed in making a decryption program yourself. 
    - It's not recommended to try it either, because you will most likely end up making the situation even worse.
