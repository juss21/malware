### [Audit Video]()

- How does ransomware work and the impact of it.
    - A malicious actor will encrypt numerous files making them, and often the systems that rely on them, unusable. If a ransom is not paid these encrypted files are often permanently locked requiring the organization to regenerate the information.

- What is ransomware?
    - Ransomware is a malware that encrypts and holds victim's personal files and information at ransom.

- How did I bypass the Anti-Viruses?
    - Didn't use any obvious ransomware text in my info file. Cause this is also detectable by AVs. (Reduced detection from 23 to 12 AVs)
    - I refactored my code, using smaller functions and imported data from another file. (Reduced detection from 12 to 10 AVs)

- How does my ransomware work?
    - I search for all files in a specified folder that end with given extentions.
    - Loop throught the files and encrypt them.

- How does my decrypting program work?
    - It asks for the correct encryption key as an input. And if the input fails to decrypt a file it asks for the key again.
    - When the key is correct, same as encryption it loops through the files and decrypts them.
